# operation nifty apes

Nifty.apes is looking to hire some amazing talent from Buidl Guidl

TLDR: NiftyApes is building leverage for your NFT portfolio and fancy mortgages from your JPEGS. Part gonzo art project, part institutional grade financial protocol we are defining what it means to be at the intersection of NFTs and DeFi one banana meme at a time. Under the hood we have created a new economic mechanism called Harberger Style Lending Auctions which solves many of the frictions in the current market and offers the opportunity to redefine the idea of ownership in lending and create a more equitable, value optimal, and regenerative debt market.

The founding team has done things like build Gitcoin Grants v0, conduct the first major CBDC study with MIT, found the ETHSecurity Community, and work at The Boston Consulting Group, Consensys, and more.

Two biggest reqs:

1. Data and backend folks, someone who's down for jamming on AWS/Lambdas etc,
2. Smart contract devs. Could be someone who's still learning but excited to dig in, specifically around more advance concepts like implementing a Diamond Pattern and building out some of our V2 features like Purchase Financing and Leveraged Trading
